### Setting up the Programming Environment

**Programming requires certain specialized tools** most of which are specific to the programming language being used. While some of these tools may come pre-installed in your computer, often you need to install and configure them yourself.

Programming in Java requires minimally the [_Java Development Kit (JDK)_](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html) to be installed in your computer. The JDK includes tools useful for developing and testing programs written in the Java programming language and running on the Java platform.
