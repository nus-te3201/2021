#### Exercise - Circle Area
        
Write a program to read the radius of a circle (a float number) from the input and print the area of the circle, rounded to five decimal places.

{{ icon_tip }} some useful hints:
* Area = PI * radius<sup>2</sup>
* You can use `math.pi` as the value of PI.
* You can use the built-in function `round` to round off a number to a specified number of decimal places. e.g., `round(1.12345, 2)` returns `1.12`

```python
Enter radius: 4.5
Area: 63.61725
```
