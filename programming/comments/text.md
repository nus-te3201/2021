### Comments

You can use comments to provide more information about the code to the reader. Any text that follows `#` (until the end of the line) is considered as a comment by the Python interpreter, and is ignored.

```python
# this is a simple hello world program

print('Hello') # start with a greeting

# read user's name from the keyboard
print('What is your name?')
name = input()
```

{{ icon_tip }} Blank lines too are ignored by the Python interpreter. You can use blank lines to improve the <tooltip content="ease of reading">readability</tooltip> of the code %%&nbsp;e.g., by using a blank line to separate one group of statements from another%%
