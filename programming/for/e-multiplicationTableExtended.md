#### Exercise - Multiplication Table (Extended)

Modify the code a program to,
* print multiplication values of up to `x 20` (not up to `x 10` as before)
* omit squares (i.e. `n*n`). Note how `8 x 8` has been omitted in the example below. Recommended: use a `continue` statement to achieve this.
* not print rows that has a value higher than 100. Note how the printing stops after `8 x 12 = 96` in the example below. Recommended: use a `break` statement for this.

```python
Enter a number: 8
8 x 1 = 8
8 x 2 = 16
8 x 3 = 24
8 x 4 = 32
8 x 5 = 40
8 x 6 = 48
8 x 7 = 56
8 x 9 = 72
8 x 10 = 80
8 x 11 = 88
8 x 12 = 96
```
