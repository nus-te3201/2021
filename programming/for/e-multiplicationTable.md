#### Exercise - Multiplication Table

Write a program to read in an integer and generate the multiplication table (for `1` to `10`) for that number. An example is given below:

```python
Enter a number: 7
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
7 x 4 = 28
7 x 5 = 35
7 x 6 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
7 x 8 = 56
7 x 9 = 63
7 x 10 = 70
```

`for i in range(10)` iterates from `0` to  `9`. You can use `range(1, 11)` to iterate from `1` to `10`.
